Thank you for purchasing The Dark Dungeon Kit. 

This package uses linear color space (Edit->Project Settings->Player->Color Space) and the deferred render path (Edit->Project Settings->Graphics->Rendering Path). Please change your project settings accordingly.

For VR it is recommended to set the shader in the floor and wall materials from Triplebrick/*Height to Triplebrick/*Standard.
