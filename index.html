		<h2>Game Update - Hitbox script tweeked as well as player movement</h2>
		<h5>September 30, 2018</h5>
		<p>Schedule of due dates has been created and should be followed to ensure project is successful.
		<img src="schedule.png" class="center">
		Hitbox script now works better and registers per hit after attaching the collider to the sword joint instead of the actual sword.  Player movement now has better animation transitions, before
		it was very clunky and didn't work quite as well as intended.

      <h2>Game Update - AI and Hitbox scripts in progress</h2>
	  <h5>September 23, 2018</h5>
      <p>Presentations concluded this week and Kevin created a deadline priority list that has to be finished before first playable presentations are due.    
	  <img src="Deadlineplanning.png" class="center">
	  <b></b>Scripts that have been added: Skeleton_Controller.cs, PlayerHitBox.cs, HitBox.cs<b></b>
	  Skeleton_Controller.cs is a script that contains the basic AI for a Skeleton enemy, path traversal is controlled by NavMeshAgent(a built in path finding tool), AI state machine is hard coded
	  to have states that switch according to player actions.  So far only follow, stop, attack, and death state is currently implemented.                       
	  <img src="SkeletonController.png" class="center">
	  PlayerHitBox.cs and HitBox.cs are almost identical in that they take GameObjects such as the player and enemy models and determine if there is a collision with their colliders to determine if hits register or not.
	  OnTriggerEnter serves this purpose for now until a more smooth aproach can be figured out since it isn't 100% reliably counting hits by the player.  If a player uses the attack button and the collider enters
	  the collider zone of the object with the script attached, their hp will be decremented.       
	  <img src="HitBox.png" class="center">
	  Throughout the week we should have a basic plan for the level design fleshed out so we can start adding assets.

      <h2>Presentations for game project ideas</h2>
	  <h5>September 16, 2018</h5>
      <p>Presentations started this week and our group coloborated in google slides to create a presentation.<br></br>
	     We met up during the week outside of class and discussed each topic that needed to be on our slides and created slides accordingly, including many different gifs for examples.<br></br>
		 The link to the slideshow can found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-fW0wwnQc4rB-BW4zXo0sDOyc4mMqQ47-l08eC2wwH8/edit?usp=sharing"><b>HERE</b></a>

      <h2>Basic scripting and assets added into the new Unity project</h2>
	  <h5>September 9, 2018</h5>
      <p>
	     <img src="unityLayout.png" class="center">
		 Paladin was taken from Mixamo along with some sword and shield animations to use as a base model for our project.
		 The staircase asset was taken from the StoneKeep asset package found in the unity store.
		 The walls and floors are basic planes with images stretched on them.<br></br>
		 Movement.cs will control the 3d model using character controller and reading inputs from WASD on the user's keyboard.
		 <img src="movement.png" class="center"><br></br>
		 CameraControl.cs will handle how the 3rd person viewing will be controlled by the player using the mouse's axis as rotation points
		 <img src="cameracontrol.png" class="center"><br></br>
		 Walk.cs will control the player's animations when an action is taken and translates it to a boolean trigger within the animator in Unity.

		 Code can be found in our github page</p>

      <h2>First Meeting and game project planning</h2>
	  <h5>September 2, 2018</h5>
      <p>Talked about the game, the assets that need to be acquired, what scripts need to be written, and features of the game to implement.  Also talked about who will do what, when everything needs to be finished and 
	  also created a github page to track project changes.
